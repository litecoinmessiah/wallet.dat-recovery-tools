I'm going to mark this thread as solved since the OP_CHECKSIG stuff is all figured out now.

I'll start a new thread for BouncyCastle related stuff.

I was able to verify the signature using the openssl command line and a bunch of cutting and pasting of hex dumps. The data input to the hash is
Code:
01 00 00 00 03 30 f3 70  1f 9b c4 64 55 2f 70 49  |.....0.p...dU/pI|

01 00 00 00                                       |....|

and the hash is

e8a875b4a6b23e507cdad56d1d74285f22fec05bfd6be2f737923c43fcc23987

If you have this value, it is correct, and you can look elsewhere.
